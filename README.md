## Repository migration notice (June/July 2021)

In order to make testing and deployment of our plugins easier we are migrating all Roadie plugins to a monorepo at https://github.com/RoadieHQ/roadie-backstage-plugins.
The plugins will still be published to the same place on NPM and will have the same package names so nothing should change for consumers of these plugins.

## Plugin Configuration Requirements

This plugin relies on the [GitHub Authentication Provider](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/github/provider) for its access to GitHub.

## Install the plugin

```bash
cd packages/app
yarn add @roadiehq/backstage-plugin-github-pull-requests
```

## Add plugin API to your Backstage instance:

```ts
// packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx
import { EntityGithubPullRequestsContent } from '@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-github-pull-requests';
...

const serviceEntityPage = (
  <EntityLayout>
    ...
    <EntityLayout.Route path="/pull-requests" title="Pull Requests">
      <EntityGithubPullRequestsContent />
    </EntityLayout.Route>
    ...
  </EntityLayout>
```

4. Run backstage app with `yarn start` and navigate to services tabs.

## Widget setup
